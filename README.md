## Features
### **1. Environmental Monitoring and Feedback**
- Real-time collection and adjustment of:
  - **Temperature and Humidity** using DHT11 sensors.
  - **Light Intensity** using TEMT6000 sensors.
- Dynamic light control:
  - **Green Light**: Indicates optimal environmental conditions.
  - **Red Light**: Alerts deviations from ideal settings.
  - **Flashing Red Light**: Signals critical conditions, prompting immediate action (e.g., closing curtains).

### **2. Personalized User Settings**
- **Real-Time Data Display**:
  - Users can monitor environmental data (temperature, humidity, and light intensity) on a simple and user-friendly web interface.
- **Customizable Thresholds**:
  - Allows users to set personalized preferences, such as cooler temperatures or brighter lighting for specific needs.
- **Streamlined Interface Design**:
  - Focus on simplicity to ensure accessibility for all users, including those with limited technical knowledge.

### **3. IoT Data Transmission**
- **Reliable Communication**:
  - Data from sensors is transmitted using the **ESP8266 WiFi module** via the MQTT protocol for real-time monitoring.
- **Dynamic Feedback**:
  - Adjustments to lighting color and brightness are automatically executed based on real-time data and user-defined preferences.
